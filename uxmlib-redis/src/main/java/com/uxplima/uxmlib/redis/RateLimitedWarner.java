/**
 * A warn sink that forwards at most one message per fixed window, so a flapping dependency cannot flood the
 * log. The first message always passes; afterwards a message is forwarded only once a full {@code windowMs}
 * has elapsed since the last one that was forwarded — the ones in between are dropped, not queued.
 *
 * <p>Thread-safe and lock-free: the "claim this window" step is a compare-and-set on the last-emitted
 * timestamp, so concurrent callers (e.g. publish-failure callbacks arriving together on an event loop) emit a
 * single message and the CAS losers drop theirs without blocking. The clock is injected so the windowing is
 * unit-testable deterministically without sleeping.
