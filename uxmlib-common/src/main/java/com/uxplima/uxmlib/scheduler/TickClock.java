/**
 * A monotonic server-uptime tick counter. Once {@link #start} schedules its global timer the count climbs by
 * one each tick, giving animations and cooldowns a cheap shared clock that never depends on wall time and so
 * cannot jump backwards over an NTP correction.
 *
 * <p>The count is an instance field (no static mutable state); a plugin holds one clock and reads it from any
 * thread via an {@link AtomicLong}. Advancing runs on the global region timer, so the value the main thread
 * reads is consistent. {@link #start} is idempotent — a second call is ignored, keeping a single timer.
