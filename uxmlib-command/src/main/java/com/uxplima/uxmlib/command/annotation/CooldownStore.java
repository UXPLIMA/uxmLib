/**
 * An optional persistence seam behind {@link Cooldowns}. The default cooldown gate keeps its windows in
 * memory, which is fine for short rate-limits but loses long ones (a daily kit, a weekly reward) across a
 * restart. A consumer that wants those to survive supplies a {@code CooldownStore} — typically backed by
 * {@code uxmlib-storage} — and {@link Cooldowns} reads through it on a cold key and writes through it when a
 * window is armed.
 *
 * <p>The contract is deliberately tiny so the command module never depends on storage: the store maps an
 * opaque key to the epoch-millis at which that key's window expires. It owns its own threading and durability;
 * implementations should be fast (they sit on the command path) and may keep their own cache. This module
 * ships no implementation — the in-memory default needs none — so a persisted store is entirely the
 * consumer's to provide.
