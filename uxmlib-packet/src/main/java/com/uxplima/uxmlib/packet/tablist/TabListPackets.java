 * The seam between pure tab-list logic and the NMS packet construction. Every packet crosses this boundary as
 * an opaque {@link Object}, so this interface — and everything that depends on it — carries no
 * {@code net.minecraft} reference and stays unit-testable against a fake. The single implementation that builds
 * real {@code ClientboundPlayerInfoUpdatePacket}/{@code ClientboundPlayerInfoRemovePacket} packets against the
 * Mojang-mapped dev bundle lives behind this port in {@code tablist.internal}.
 *
 * <p>These packets are how you do the per-viewer tab things native Paper cannot: a custom display name, a
 * client-side sort order, and a custom skin for an entry you fully control. Each method returns one built
 * packet; {@link #send(Player, Object)} writes it to a viewer's connection, so the same packet can be sent to
 * many viewers without rebuilding it.
