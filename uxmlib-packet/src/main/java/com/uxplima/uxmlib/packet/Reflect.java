 * Reads a server static field by its Mojang-mapped name. The data-watcher accessors a metadata packet needs
 * ({@code EntityDataAccessor} objects on {@code Display}/{@code TextDisplay} and friends) are package-private
 * static fields, so a tiny guarded reflective read is the only way to reach them. Reading the accessor object
 * rather than hard-coding its network id keeps us off the volatile integer indices.
 *
 * <p>This helper is stateless: it does the read once per call and fails loudly. Callers that need the value
 * across many packets cache it themselves (assign it to a {@code final} field at construction), which keeps the
 * reflection off every hot path without this class holding any mutable state.
