/**
 * Rewrites an outgoing {@code ClientboundPlayerInfoUpdatePacket} so that the tab-list entries of selected
 * players are forced <em>unlisted</em> — present as known client entities (their skins and above-head names on
 * the real entity still work) but not shown as a row in the tab list. This is the clean mechanism for a
 * synthetic tab list that hides real players: rather than removing entries or dropping the packet (which would
 * also strip the entity), an interceptor passes each outbound player-info packet through {@link #forceUnlisted}
 * and forwards the rewritten copy, leaving any entry it owns (its own filler rows) untouched.
 *
 * <p>The 1.19.3+ tab protocol carries a per-entry {@code listed} flag; an entry with {@code listed=false} is not
 * drawn in the tab list. {@link #forceUnlisted} returns a new packet whose entries matching the
 * {@code suppress} predicate have {@code listed=false} and every other field of every entry (uuid, profile,
 * latency, game mode, display name, list order, the action set itself) left exactly as it was — so an
 * unmatched entry (a filler the caller added with {@code listed=true}) is carried through verbatim.
 *
 * <p>This class holds <em>no</em> {@code net.minecraft} reference: the actual entry reconstruction is in the
 * Mojang-mapped {@link NmsPlayerInfoUpdates}, which {@link #forceUnlisted} delegates to. The only logic here is
 * the pure, unit-testable {@link #affectsListing} guard. A rewrite is only meaningful when the packet's action
 * set actually carries the {@code listed} flag — an {@code ADD_PLAYER} (which seats the initial {@code listed}
 * state) or an {@code UPDATE_LISTED}. A packet whose actions touch neither (a pure latency or display-name
 * update) cannot change a client's tab visibility, so it is a no-op: {@link #forceUnlisted} returns {@code null}
 * and the caller forwards the original unchanged.
