/**
 * The seam between pure NPC logic and the NMS packet construction for a fake-player NPC. Every packet crosses
 * this boundary as an opaque {@link Object}, so this interface — and everything that depends on it — carries no
 * {@code net.minecraft} reference and stays unit-testable against a fake. The single implementation that builds
 * the real Mojang-mapped packets against the dev bundle lives behind this port in {@code npc.internal}.
 *
 * <p>A fake-player NPC is shown to a client in a fixed sequence: first a player-info entry carrying the name
 * and skin so the client knows how to render the body, then the entity spawn at a position and rotation, then
 * the look packets that aim its head and body. The client links the skin to the spawned entity because the
 * spawn UUID equals the player-info entry's profile id — so the spawn must reuse the same {@code profileId}.
 * The caller typically removes the player-info entry from the visible tab a moment after spawning (a short
 * delay so the client has parsed the entry); {@link #tabRemove(UUID)} builds that removal. Each method returns
 * one built packet; {@link #send(Player, Object)} writes it to a viewer's connection, so the same packet can be
 * sent to many viewers without rebuilding it.
