/**
 * Upgrades an item blob written by an older Minecraft version to the format the running server expects.
 *
 * <p>The mechanism is Paper's native DataFixerUpper: {@link ItemStack#deserializeBytes(byte[])} runs the
 * stored bytes through Mojang's data fixers, so reading an older blob on a newer server already yields a
 * correct, upgraded {@link ItemStack}. This helper layers two things on top of that read:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #needsMigration(byte[])} — a pure check over the {@link ItemSerialization} header that says
 *       whether a blob predates the running server's data version (and so will be fixed up on read).
 *   <li>{@link #migrate(byte[])} / {@link #migrateItem(byte[])} — deserialize (Paper applies the fix) and
 *       re-stamp the result at the current data version, so the upgrade is persisted and the blob no longer
 *       reports as needing migration.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Migrating an already-current blob is harmless: it round-trips to an equivalent item re-stamped at the
 * same version. The cross-version fixing itself (e.g. a 1.20 blob loaded on 1.21) cannot be reproduced in a
 * single-version unit test; it is exercised on a real upgraded server. The version-gap detection and the
 * re-stamp round-trip are covered by tests.
