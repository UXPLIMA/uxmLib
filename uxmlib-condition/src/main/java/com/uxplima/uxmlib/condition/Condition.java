/**
 * The condition SPI: a single predicate over a {@link ConditionRequest}. Implementations are pure with
 * respect to the request's subject — they read the subject and resolver and return whether the condition
 * holds. They must <b>not</b> mutate the request's error sink or cancel flag themselves; collecting failure
 * messages and applying a {@link FailurePolicy} is the job of the {@link ConditionList} that drives them, so
 * a condition stays reusable under any policy.
 *
 * <p>{@link PlaceholderCondition} is the built-in implementation that covers most config-only use cases.
