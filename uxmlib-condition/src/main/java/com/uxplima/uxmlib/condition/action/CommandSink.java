/**
 * The seam through which a command action dispatches a (placeholder-resolved) command line. Production wiring
 * passes a sink backed by {@code Bukkit#dispatchCommand} — for a {@code [console]} action with the console
 * sender, for a {@code [player]} action with the target player. Tests pass a capturing sink so the {@code
 * Bukkit} static stays out of pure parser tests while the resolved command line is still asserted.
 *
 * <p>Keeping the contract here (rather than reaching into Bukkit from the action closure) means a command
 * action is the same pure closure in a test and in production; only the sink differs.
