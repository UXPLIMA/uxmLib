 * The backend seam an {@link OnlineDataManager} writes through. It is deliberately the smallest contract that
 * lets the manager load a player's value on join and persist it on quit and on a timer: one blocking
 * {@link #load} and one blocking {@link #save}, both keyed by player {@link UUID}.
 *
 * <p>Keeping this seam here — rather than depending on {@code uxmlib-storage} — is what lets the manager live
 * in {@code uxmlib-integration} without dragging the storage module (and its JDBC stack) onto every consumer.
 * The consumer wires the seam to whatever backend they already run: a {@code uxmlib-storage}
 * {@code Repository}/{@code WriteBehindStorage}, a flat file, an in-memory map for tests. Both methods are
 * called off the main thread by the manager (on {@code Scheduler.async}), so an implementation may block on
 * I/O; it must be safe to call from a pool thread and must never touch the Bukkit API.
 *
 * @param <V> the per-player value type
