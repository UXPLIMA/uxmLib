/**
 * A third-person-only nameplate: a follow hologram shown to nearby players but never to its own wearer, the
 * way a name-tag floats over a player for everyone else but not for them. It restricts the hologram to
 * explicit viewers (native {@code setVisibleByDefault(false)}) at construction, then {@link #refreshViewers}
 * shows it to the current nearby players minus the wearer and hides it from anyone who has left that set —
 * all through Paper's per-viewer {@code show/hideEntity}, no packets.
 *
 * <p>Pair it with {@link HologramFollow} to keep the nameplate above the wearer's head: follow for the
 * movement, and call {@link #refreshViewers} each tick from your {@code Scheduler} with the nearby players.
 * The {@code show/hide} calls must run on the hologram's region thread (Folia).
