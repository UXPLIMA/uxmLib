/**
 * The per-viewer context handed to a {@link GuiItem} when its icon and action are resolved. It carries
 * who is looking at the menu, which menu and slot, so a dynamic item can render differently for each
 * player — a localized name, the viewer's own head, a value that depends on their permissions. The
 * viewer's {@link #locale()} is exposed so text resolves per player through Adventure.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #effectivePlayer()} is the player a placeholder modifier resolves against, which is usually
 * the {@link #viewer()} but can differ — an admin viewing another player's menu wants <em>that</em> player's
 * stats on the icon, not their own. It defaults to the viewer; use {@link #withEffectivePlayer} to retarget.
