/**
 * Drives a menu's viewer lifecycle: showing it (deferring the open over a sleeping player), closing it,
 * and scheduling the next-tick retry/reopen that those paths need. Split out of {@code AbstractGui} so the
 * scheduler-backed open/close plumbing lives in one place while the menu class keeps the slot, click, and
 * inventory work.
 *
 * <p>The owning menu is handed to each call rather than kept as a field, so the holder can be built in a
 * field initializer without {@code this} escaping the menu's constructor. The deferred retry and the
 * prevent-close reopen re-enter through {@code gui.open(viewer)}, so a subclass that overrides {@code open}
 * (paginated/scrolling menus re-render there) still runs its override on the retry, as a direct call would.
