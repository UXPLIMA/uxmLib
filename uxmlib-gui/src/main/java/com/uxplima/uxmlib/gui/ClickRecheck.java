/**
 * The anti-desync re-check (item 39). A dynamic, stateful, or animated icon can change between the moment a
 * menu was rendered and the moment a viewer clicks it — the player may be acting on a stale icon. Before a
 * click action runs, the framework confirms the slot still holds the icon the click targeted; if it no
 * longer matches, the action is cancelled and skipped so a click never fires against an icon that is no
 * longer there.
 *
 * <p>The comparison is a pure predicate so it can be unit-tested without a live inventory. It is cheap for
 * us because items already resolve from a {@code RenderContext}; this only compares the captured icon to the
 * one currently in the slot. Pattern from nightcore (re-run visibility at click) / triumph-gui.
